Story   (Parts I'm sure should occur)
-----
Someone asks for techies help to Login[2] to a remote system and get some info.
.
.
.       Part Immediately after falling into the alternate world
As he regained his consiousness all he could here was a repeating chant.
"HURAKEN WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH THE MAZE[1] , HURAKEN WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH THE MAZE
HURAKEN WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH THE MAZE" .His vision cleared and he saw a large 
creature fly .It was a Dragon disappearing into the distance still roaring 
"HURAKEN WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH THE MAZE".Who is Huraken ? and what Maze ?
So many questions and yet one question shadowed all the others . How did he just 
see a dragon ? He must definitely be dreaming .Mind still wandering he felt a tap
on his shoulder.He looked up and saw a young man with a brawny build yet bruises 
all over.But the bruises did'nt seem to bother the guy ."Name's Azriel.Who are you ?"
he asked .And Gamer answered with his alias "UltGamer but call me Gamer" .
"Okay Gamer what brings you to these parts ?"."Where am I ?What is this place?"
asked the befuddled Techie ."This is nowhere. And YOU should'nt be here."
